## Installation Instructions

Follow these step-by-step instructions to install and configure the G13 Linux Driver:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Linux kernel 5.x or higher
- Kernel headers for your current kernel version
- Build essentials (gcc, make)
- Git

Install prerequisites on Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) git
```

Install prerequisites on Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install kernel-devel kernel-headers gcc make git
```

Install prerequisites on Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel linux-headers git
```

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AreteDriver/G13LogitechOPS.git
   cd G13LogitechOPS
   ```

2. **Compile the kernel driver**
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will compile the G13 kernel module from source.

3. **Load the driver into the system**
   ```bash
   sudo make install
   sudo modprobe g13
   ```

4. **Verify the driver is loaded**
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep g13
   dmesg | tail -20
   ```
   You should see the g13 module listed and relevant kernel messages indicating successful initialization.

5. **Configure automatic loading (optional)**
   To load the driver automatically at boot:
   ```bash
   echo "g13" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/g13.conf
   ```

### Uninstallation

To remove the driver:
```bash
sudo modprobe -r g13
sudo make uninstall
```

## Example Commands/Screenshots

This section provides examples of how to use the G13 Linux Driver and showcases its capabilities.

### LCD Screen Animations

*Placeholder: Screenshot showing custom animations on the G13 LCD display*

Example commands to display custom text:
```bash
# Display a simple message on LCD
echo "Hello World" > /sys/class/g13/lcd0/text

# Display system information on LCD (may vary by system)
echo "CPU: $(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2}')" > /sys/class/g13/lcd0/text
```

### RGB Lighting Setup

*Placeholder: Image showing different RGB lighting configurations*

Example commands for RGB control:
```bash
# Set backlight to red
echo "255,0,0" > /sys/class/g13/rgb0/color

# Set backlight to breathing blue effect
echo "breathing" > /sys/class/g13/rgb0/mode
echo "0,0,255" > /sys/class/g13/rgb0/color

# Set backlight to color cycle mode
echo "cycle" > /sys/class/g13/rgb0/mode
```

### Macro Configuration

*Placeholder: Example of macro configuration file*

Example macro definition:
```bash
# Assign a macro to G1 key
echo "macro G1 'Hello World'" > /sys/class/g13/macro0/define
```

### Joystick Calibration
