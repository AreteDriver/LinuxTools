# 🚀 How to Push Version 2.0.0 to GitHub

## Step 1: Download This Entire Folder

Download the entire `/mnt/user-data/outputs/LikX/` folder to your computer.

This contains Version 2.0.0 with all premium features.

---

## Step 2: Open Terminal in the Folder

```bash
cd path/to/LikX  # wherever you downloaded it
```

---

## Step 3: Initialize Git (if not already done)

```bash
# If you already have a GitHub repo, skip to Step 4
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release v2.0.0 - Premium Edition with 30+ features"
```

---

## Step 4: Connect to Your GitHub Repository

### Option A: If you already created a repo on GitHub
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LikX.git

# If remote already exists, update it:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LikX.git
```

### Option B: If you haven't created a repo yet
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `LikX`
3. Description: "The best screenshot tool for Linux with OCR, pin-to-desktop, and 30+ features"
4. Public repository
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"
7. Then run the commands from Option A

---

## Step 5: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push the code
git push -u origin main

# If you get an error about branch names, try:
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# If you get errors about existing content:
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Version 2.0.0 is on GitHub

Check these files on GitHub to verify you have Version 2.0.0:

1. **src/__init__.py** should say:
   ```python
   __version__ = "2.0.0"
   ```

2. **You should have 13 files in src/ folder:**
   - capture.py
   - config.py
   - editor.py
   - effects.py ⭐
   - history.py ⭐
   - hotkeys.py
   - notification.py
   - ocr.py ⭐
   - pinned.py ⭐
   - test_config.py
   - ui.py
   - uploader.py
   - __init__.py

3. **You should have premium features documentation:**
   - PREMIUM_FEATURES.md ⭐
   - DISTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md
   - EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md

If you see all these, you have Version 2.0.0! ✅
